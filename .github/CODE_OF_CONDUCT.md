## Code Of Conduct
We should be setting a good example and be welcoming to all. And should be listening to all feedback from every developer and respect their viewpoints and opinions.

### small, logical commits
A PR or a commit should be focused on a single problem, though that problem may be reasonable to be broken into a few logical commits. For example, the new feature of adding a new field on collecting should be divided into at least three steps. First, extended declaration type. Then, add some code in collecting or building data(should be split if there were large codes). Finally, test and verify in your unit test and e2e.

### Always rebase and green master
